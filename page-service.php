                <p>“I never understood how Kitchen Designers could take a room as important as the kitchen and not take
                    into account the rest of the home. When we opened up SKD Studios we new we wanted to do things
                    differently. We wanted a place that homeowners could come and we could help them create an inviting,
                    livable and amazing space from start to finish. At SKD Studios we understand the importance of
                    educating our clients on the products available.</p>

                <p>We will help you choose the best options for your space as well as cost effective alternatives to
                    help enhance the way you use your space. No matter what size the project is or how big the scope of
                    work is, we will help you devise a plan that not only fits your budget but changes the way you live
                    in your space.”</p>

                <p>We believe that the best results come from a blank canvas and a solid plan. Having SKD Studios at the
                    table with your architect and contractor from the very beginning is the surest and safest route to
                    building the best result. From conception to completion, our designs will transform the way you
                    live.</p>

                    clients home to introduce ourselves and educate the client about our services and products. At this
                    point we make an appointment to meet at the house and gather more information. If you live outside
                    of Newport Beach, we charge a nominal fee to come to the space to take field measurements, look at
                    the scope of the project, take some initial pictures and most importantly go over the budget for the
                    job.</p>

                <p class="mb-0">After our initial meeting at the space, we will present the client with a design
                    proposal agreement. This will breakdown everything that will be involved in creating the perfect
                    kitchen or bath for your needs. The design proposal is a flat rate fee based on the scope of the
                    work involved in creating the space. Once the design proposal is signed and the retainer is
                    collected the first phase of the project is officially underway.</p>

                <p class="mb-0">Our designers get hard at work to begin putting your dream space to paper. We produce
                    photo-realistic renderings of the space, make initial selections of all material needed, and do an
                    initial budget based on previous meetings. The time-frame for this part of the process can vary
                    depending on how quickly the client can come to decisions. Once the initial plans are complete, we
                    will meet again in the studio to go over the details. It is at this meeting that we will make any
                    changes necessary and begin initial talks with contractors/architects to discuss the construction
                    portion of the project.</p>

                <p class="mb-0">Once we have all bids together and have made the final changes to the plans, we will
                    enter into a contract to order the products for the job. We will order the cabinets and counter tops
                    first and begin laying out the schedule and timeline for the project. SKD studios is armed with a
                    team of qualified and licensed contractors that we trust immensely. If you are working with your own
                    contractor, we are happy to work with them as well. We have built relationships with trades that are
                    under a mutual understanding that creating a space that is beautiful is just as important as
                    creating a space on time and on budget.</p>
